- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wesjiii

These are some projects that I made using JavaScript.

Projects:
- Pizza Menu
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Calculator

- Pizza Menu:
  - This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.
  - It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order

- Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
  - Just like the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, you select the appropriate squares to get 3 in a row. Win to hear a champion's song. There will be a line indicating the order of 3 in a row. If you lose or tie, play again!
 
- Calculator:
  - This is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a culculator.
